# MachineLearning-ImageClassification

This project is a simple demonstration of image classification using the TensorFlow library. It uses the Fashion MNIST dataset, which includes 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories.

## Installation

The project was developed on Google Colab. To run it, you need access to Google Colab, and you should be familiar with Python and TensorFlow. 

## Usage

Open the notebook in Google Colab and run the cells sequentially. The notebook will guide you through loading the dataset, pre-processing the data, training a model, evaluating the model, and making predictions.
